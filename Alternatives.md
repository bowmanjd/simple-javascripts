Simple-JavaScripts is a very minimalist set of only a few tools. Other, much larger, libraries exist, known for their flexibility and convenience. If you need something more than what Simple-JavaScripts has to offer, I recommend one of the following:

  * [Prototype](http://prototypjs.org)
  * [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
  * [MooTools](http://mootools.net)

[MooTools](http://mootools.net) includes a nice [tooltip library](http://demos.mootools.net/Tips). Other tooltip libraries exist for the other frameworks, but I have not tried them.

[jQuery](http://jquery.com) has a simple and flexible modal box called [ThickBox](http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/), and [Control.Modal](http://livepipe.net/projects/control_modal) is a powerful one for [Prototype](http://prototypjs.org) (and [script.aculo.us](http://script.aculo.us)).
